# Theming your Opal application

Opal applicatoins ship with a basic theme that is good enough to use in production,
but we expect that most applications will wish to customise the look and feel.
Accordingly, we support a range of different theming options.

## Basic Options

Basic theming comes in the form of settings which can be tweaked.
You can give your application a different name, logo, and set the version number.

## Overriding CSS and templates

You can override the CSS to change the core colours et cetera, and there are some
key templates that you can tweak.

### Changing the home page.

By default, the home page of an opal application simply renders the `welcome.html`
template.

## Custom Themes

Comprehensive re-skins likely require you to write your own Opal theme. You can
do this within an application directly, or if you definitely have a theme you
want to use in multiple applications, you can write a theme plugin.

### Example themes

We have created a number of example themes for Opal. These are intended to demonstrate
the possibilities rather than for production use.
